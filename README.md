# MEAN-workshop

MEAN comprises of four components; MongoDB, Express, Angular and NodeJS.

MEAN is a user-friendly full-stack JavaScript framework ideal for building dynamic websites and applications. It is a free and open-source stack designed to supply developers with a quick and organized method for creating rapid prototypes of MEAN-based web applications. One of the main benefits of the MEAN stack is that a single language, JavaScript, runs on every level of the application, making it an efficient and modern approach to web development.
